### Description
An application that will store credentials under a master account.

### System Requirements
The application should run fine on any OS.

### Set Up
cd to server folder<br>
run `npm start`<br><br>
cd to client folder<br>
run `npm start`<br>
>if `npm start` gives issues, run `npm install` first to install dependencies

Local web server should start up, and shortly after a web browser should automatically open.<br>
If not, type `localhost:3000` in the URL to access the application.

### Comments
The current database uses a trial version of AWS. Please bear in mind that
it will eventually expire and the application will not work as intended.
